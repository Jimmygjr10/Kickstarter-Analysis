# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project 
In this project I analyzed data that consisted of multiple fundraises in the world to uncover a trend that could help point my friend Louise in the right direction.I analyzed the  differnce in fundraising launch dates and the funding goals.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to use my Excel prowess to process and clean the data. Then perform ecploratory analysis to the data. Lastly I used prowess in Pivot tables & charts to present my findings to Louise.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some challenges I encountered was the pivot tables and getting them to display exactly what I wanted. Also ran into some isues using the formula but nothing a little reading and google couldn't help fix.

## Results
- Theater Outcomes based on launch date show that May and June yield the best retrun for being successful with fundraising. Also November and December is the worst time to start a fund raising campiagn.
- The data seems to show that fund raises with a low goal amount set seem to do the better than a fundraising group with high expectations.
- As far as limitations there are many because there are more variables in play than the launch date and goal amount. That data is only a piece of the whole puzzle.
- For this scenario I believe anothe good graph could be the bar chart since we have a group of data that we are comaparing.
